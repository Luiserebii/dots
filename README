# vim-settings

Just a compilation of files and information on my personal vim configuration for reference.

In the global:
  1. Navigate to the global vimrc file (in Debian/Ubuntu, this will be in /etc/vim/vimrc), and uncomment/add the following block:
```
if has("autocmd")
  filetype plugin indent on
endif
```
